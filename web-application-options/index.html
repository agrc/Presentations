					<h1>Introductions</h1>

					Larry, Curly and Moe at AGRC the state of Utah's GIS shop
					<aside class= "notes">As I am sure you are aware, AGRC uses ESRI in our technology stack.  We are approaching this from the view point of a person doing GIS that has some data they want folks to look at and interact with.  At first we are focusing on quick easy low cost solutions that folks can utilize even if they have no desktop GIS software.  This leads into the next topic "Think before you leap!" </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Think before you leap</h1>
					What about that parachute? The one your Mom gave you
					</script>
					<aside class= "notes">This is the most important part! Take a deep breath when you have a new idea! You need to have a plan, a strategy to move forward, it is important you take it one step at a time and document it! Make sure – as quickly and as cheaply as you can – that you are building the right it before you build it right.  You can build something that works great, even perfect, but if nobody wants to use it?  then what?</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>The GIS Mind</h1>
					Don't kill the messenger!
					</script>
					<aside class= "notes">You as the GIS person, you will be doing the work or interpeting the clients needs in a GIS/Development language to a programmer, kind of caught in the middle.  Lets start with an example.  You work for the Highway Patrol in the data section.  A person comes to you and says they want to see crashes on a map in a website.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Goals</h1>

					Define success for the project in a page or less
					<aside class= "notes">What are your high level goals you want to accomplish?  I want to show crashes and information about them on a map. That is pretty broad isn't it? lets break it down.  You could write high level stuff (epics) and then break each one down to user stories</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Requirements/User stories</h1>

					As a <strong>type of user</strong>, I want <strong>some goal</strong> so that <strong>some reason</strong>
					<h3>Don't forget to define success!!</h3>

					Create a scope that will satisfy all stakeholders.
					<aside class= "notes">It takes a while to write really good user stories.  If your using "and" in the stories then you are not writing them in a simple enough form. Going through this process will help you cover all the things you want to do and will help the client focus on what they are really trying to accomplish.  You may need to cut back on some of the ideas as it may take too long and be too expensive</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Data and Process Flow Charts</h1>

					<h3>Where did that data come from?</h3>
					And What am I trying to do?

					<aside class= "notes">This can help you understand all the process steps that someone or you will need to go through, whether preparing data or using the app. At this point you should have a good handle on what the requirements are.  You should be able to make a better educated decision on what path is best.  However, sometimes it takes a bit of building to help a stakeholder make a descision. Start simple, remember that idea of build it as simple and as cheaply as possible to see if people are going to use it. </aside>

					Non-technical audiences.
					However, story maps can also serve highly specialized audiences by
					summarizing issues for managers and decision makers. They can help teams or colleagues communicate with colleagues. Remember, it is based on a webmap.
