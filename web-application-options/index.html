					<h1>Introductions</h1>

					Larry, Curly and Moe at AGRC the state of Utah's GIS shop
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>Introductions</li>
							<li>AGRC journey steve story</li>
							<li>ESRI tech stack</li>
							<li>Our approach for this presentation</li>
							<li>Easy low cost solutions</li>
							<li>no desktop software required - kind of</li>
						</ul>
						This is where I should introduce us as part of AGRC.  As I am sure you are aware, AGRC uses ESRI in our technology stack.  We are approaching this from the view point of a person doing GIS that has some data they want folks to look at and interact with.  At first we are focusing on the importance of working out the requirements. we also want to make sure everyone understands where to look for possible quick easy low cost solutions that folks can utilize even if they have no desktop GIS software.  This leads into the next topic "Think before you leap!" </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Think before you leap</h1>
					What about that parachute? The one your Mom gave you
					</script>
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>busy schedules</li>
							<li>need to have a plan if going to be successful</li>
							<li>a strategy</li>
							<li>document things</li>
							<li>build the righ it, don't just build it right</li>
							<li>How do you know you are making he right decisions</li>
							<li>Don't fall into the trap of choosing the same routine you have developed over time</li>
							<li>MVP</li>
						</ul>
						This is the most important part! Take a deep breath when you have a new idea! We are all super busy and working on many things, so if you are going to be successful. You need to have a plan, a strategy to move forward, it is important you take it one step at a time and document it! Make sure – as quickly and as cheaply as you can – that you are building the right it before you build it right. You can build something that works great, even perfect, but if nobody wants to use it?  then what? Test your assumptions, How do you know you are making the right decisions?  you don't, you are just choosing from the same rountine you have developed over time.  Some folks call this an MVP or Minimum Viable Product.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>The GIS Mind</h1>
					Don't kill the messenger!
					</script>
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>GIS person, client, programmer may all be the same person</li>
							<li>you are a negotiator</li>
							<li>Crashes on a map, explain</li>
							<li>Try to have folks state the problem not the solution</li>
						</ul>
						You as the GIS person, you will be doing the work or interpeting the clients needs in a GIS/Development language to a programmer and you may wear all three hats!, kind of caught in the middle.  Lets start with an example.  You work for the Highway Patrol in the data section.  A person comes to you and says they want to see crashes on a map in a website. That sounds fairly simple, show something on a map, but then you as the GIS person, start to think of what that really means, you start to ask lots of questions and maybe even give some suggestions.  You should really try to get the person to state the problems and not the solution!  This can be hard, super hard. People want to give you solutions. </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Goals</h1>

					Define success for the project in a page or less
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>What are the high level goals</li>
							<li>Crashes on a map, break down the goals</li>
							<li>goals come through meetings with stakeholders</li>
							<li>Tune their expectations to the amount of money they have or time</li>
							<li>What is possible with more money</li>
						</ul>
						What are your high level goals you want to accomplish?  I want to show crashes and information about them on a map. That is pretty broad isn't it? lets break it down.  You could write high level stuff (epics) and then break each one down to user stories.  These high level goals can come through a meeting with the stakeholders, each stakeholder at the beginning may percieve their needs as being different from the others.  You need to learn how to listen to all the ideas being thrown around and explore them in a way to breed consensus.  Most projects already have a budget, some number that cannot be exceeded.  You need to learn to tune expectations to the $ amount they have, or let them know what is possible for more money. </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Requirements/User stories</h1>

					As a <strong>type of user</strong>, I want <strong>some goal</strong> so that <strong>some reason</strong>
					<h3>Don't forget to define success!!</h3>

					Create a scope that will satisfy all stakeholders.
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>Read the user story</li>
							<li>User stories are an easy unit to estimate time with</li>
							<li>define success</li>
							<li>maybe need to build something small and cheap as a test </li>
						</ul>
						It takes a while to write really good user stories.  If your using "and" in the stories then you are not writing them in a simple enough form. Going through this process will help you cover all the things you want to do and will help the client focus on what they are really trying to accomplish.  You may need to cut back on some of the ideas as it may take too long and be too expensive.At this point you should have a good handle on what the requirements are.  You should be able to make a better educated decision on what path is best.  However, sometimes it takes a bit of building to help a stakeholder make a descision. Start simple, remember that idea of build it as simple and as cheaply as possible to see if people are going to use it.</aside>

					<h1>Data and Process Flow Charts</h1>

					<h3>Where did that data come from?</h3>
					And What am I trying to do?

					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>Understanding process steps</li>
							<li>Work or data flows</li>
							<li>does the data support the app</li>
							<li>don't design the database first</li>
							<li>what tasks does the user want to perform</li>
							<li>User requirements can drive how data is stored</li>
							<li>Test your assumptions</li>
						</ul>
						This can help you understand all the process steps that someone or you will need to go through, whether preparing data or using the app.  There are many possibilities, you may realize that the data does not support what you want the app to do.  You also need to be very careful here not to put the cart before the horse.  You must not design a database before you know the user requirements and tasks the user wants to perform and in what order. This can greatly affect how the data may be stored.  You must test all your assumptions. </aside>

					<h1>Parting the Clouds</h1>

					Each challenge may have a different approach to a unique solution
					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>Each challenge is unique, don't look at all the same, no cookie cutter</li>
							<li>Amazon Prime Air</li>
							<li>But you don't need a spaceship to mow your lawn, no wallace and grommet or robot to make toast.</li>
						</ul>

						Don't get hung up trying to overcome each challenge you face the same way as the last one.  You need to be open to coming up with a solution based on what the challenge is rather than using your cookie cutter. I think an example of this is Amazon delivery by drone? (Prime Air) when we think of deliverying packages we think of putting them on a combonation of trucks and airplanes, and then person beating on our door to leave it for us. By comparison delivery by drone seems out of the ordinary way of thinking.  </aside>

					<h1>Just how long will this development process take?</h1>
					Eons, Many Eons


					<aside class= "notes">
					<ul>
							<li>Takes a long time</li>
							<li>Break things into smaller parts</li>
							<li>no user stories make it hard to estimate level of effort</li>
						</ul>
						A whole lot longer than you think!! Don't forget other work, vacations, getting sick, holidays, other "Emergencies".  The hopeful part is that you now have a good idea on what it will take to pull off a project or task based on your preliminary work. You should break things down, but larger sections, UI, DB, User management etc. </aside>
