A Few of our Favorite Things
============================
2015 ESRI Dev Summit Abstract

Within the last few years, front-end development tooling has made major strides. It seems that everyday we discover (or create) a new tool and think to ourselves, "How did we live without this"? This presentation will outline just a few of our favorite tools that make our lives easier such as [`grunt-esri-slurp`](https://github.com/steveoh/grunt-esri-slurp), [`amd-butler`](https://github.com/agrc/AmdButler), [`travis-ci`](https://travis-ci.org/), [`sauce-labs`](https://saucelabs.com/), [`bower`](http://bower.io/) and others.

Come and see how AGRC wires these technologies together to enable rapid development while improving code quality.


### Outline

bower
- Do we even need this one? It's been around a while
- Maybe just a quick mention as a set up for grunt-esri-slurp
    - Wouldn't it be nice if we could bower install esri

grunt-esri-slurp
- http://gis.utah.gov/grunt-esri-slurp/

AMD Butler
- show adding modules by hand
- show sorting
- show adding
- show removing
- highlight esri modules and how grunt-esri-slurp made this possible

saucelabs
- maybe we don't need this one?
- could just mention it

travis-ci
- show .travis.yml
- performance tip: container based architecture
- show how grunt-esri-slurp makes it possible to run tests and do a build

grunt-arcgis-press
- will it be to a point that we can show it off?
