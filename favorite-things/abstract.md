A Few of our Favorite Things
============================
2015 ESRI Dev Summit Abstract

Within the last few years, front-end development tooling has made major strides. It seems that everyday we discover (or create) a new tool and think to ourselves, "How did we live without this"? This presentation will outline just a few of our favorite tools that make our lives easier such as [`grunt-esri-slurp`](https://github.com/steveoh/grunt-esri-slurp), [`amd-butler`](https://github.com/agrc/AmdButler), [`travis-ci`](https://travis-ci.org/), [`sauce-labs`](https://saucelabs.com/), [`bower`](http://bower.io/) and others.

Come and see how AGRC wires these technologies together to enable rapid development while improving code quality.
